[Live Preview](https://norphel.github.io/odin-calculator/)

This project involved building a calculator that performs basic calculations on the go. 
That is, the calculator doesn't first get the full expression and calculate following operator precedence rules, but perform the calculations with pair of operands and a operator as when they are entered by the user.

This project required implementation of various concepts taught in the foundations chapters so far such as:
- building the page structure with HTML elements
- styling the page with CSS, especially CSS flexbox
- JavaScript fundamentals such as data types, functions, DOM manipulations
- dividing the problem into small solvable chunks

TODO:
- add keyboard support
